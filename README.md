### History as of 6.11.2023

This used to be a modern nextjs-blog with wordpress-json backend, but since [AYY deprecates Otax](https://www.ayy.fi/fi/ayy-lakkauttaa-yhdistysten-verkkosivupalvelut) ðŸ¥²ðŸ«  everything needs to be moved to a cost-effective (read = free) hosting. 

Couple hours were spent  
Computer keys we're pressed  
Now we have this site  


### Develompent

These will help if you try to dev this on modern mac. 

1. [Install requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements)
2. Cry
3. Check out why compiling ruby 3.1.3 fails and find [this issue](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build/discussions/2245)
4. Wonder why old ruby still exists even with `rbenv global 3.1.3` and use [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10940736/rbenv-not-changing-ruby-version) to sort things.
5. Enjoy
